# CP1404 Practicals Repository

Welcome to my CP1404 Practicals repository! This repository contains all of the practical assignments I completed for the CP1404 - Programming ll course at James Cook University. Here you will find a wide variety of projects that demonstrate my learning journey from programming basics to more complex concepts.

## About Me

My name is Kui Mengcen and I am an Information Technology major at James Cook University who is constantly exploring new technologies and practices to improve my programming skills. During my time in the CP1404 course, I have gained a deeper understanding of clean code and effective programming patterns.
## Lessons Learned About Succinct Code

Throughout my studies, I have learned many valuable lessons about writing concise, maintainable code, including

- Consistency is key**: Adopting a consistent coding style and naming conventions improves code readability and maintainability.
- **Keep it simple**: Striving for simplicity in code helps to achieve solutions that are easier to understand, debug, and extend.
- Refactor regularly**: Refactoring code to improve its structure without changing its functionality can significantly improve code quality and longevity.
